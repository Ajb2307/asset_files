    Description = [[The exoplanet candidate stars are likely hosts for exoplanets. These
            are stars plucked from NASA's Kepler and TESS space telescopes. Further observations
            are needed to confirm a planet's existence. Rather than represent them
            photo-realistically, with accurate colors, we choose to visualize them as generic,
            colored stars. The nature of these stars is not important, it is the sheer numbers
            of potential exoplanets that allows us to wonder just how many we will find in the
            entire Galaxy. Colors: Yellow denote Kepler candidates, Orange stars are from the K2
            mission, and green stars are from TESS. Census: 7,225 candidate stars.]]
