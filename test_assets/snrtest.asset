    Description = [[A supernova remnant is the nebulous gas left over from a supernova
            explosion. This gas expands at great speeds and rams into the surrounding
            interstellar gas. This excites the surrounding gas and causes it to glow, producing
            the nebulous cloud we observe from Earth. A supernova remnant contains a neutron
            star or pulsar at its center, the core of the dying star. The cloud that enshrouds
            the core does not last long, though. After about 50,000 years, the gas mixes into
            the interstellar medium and no longer glows. Astronomically, this is a very short
            time, so the supernova remnants we see must be left from explosions that have
            occurred recently, cosmically speaking. Census: 112 supernova remnants.]]
