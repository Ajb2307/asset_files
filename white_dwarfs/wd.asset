    Description = [[A white dwarf is the core of a dying star. These are dim objects that
        are roughly the size of Earth but with the density of a sun-like star. Stars that are
        not massive enough to end in a neutron star or black hole will evolve into a white
        dwarf. This is the ultimate fate of over 95% of the stars in our Galaxy. As the
        star is dying, the outer layers will expand out and the gas will glow and become a
        planetary nebula, while the core of the star transforms into a white dwarf. Census:
        192,613 white dwarfs.]]
