    Description = [[An open star cluster is a loose assemblage of stars numbering from
      hundreds to thousands that are bound by their mutual gravitation. Because these are
      young stars, we expect to see them in the star-forming regions of our Galaxy, namely
      in the spiral arms. For this reason, open clusters exist, for the most part, in the
      plane of the Galaxy and indicate relatively recent star formation. Census: 1,867 star
      clusters.]]
