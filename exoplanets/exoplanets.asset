    Description = [[Extrasolar planets, or exoplanets, are a relatively new phenomenon in
      astronomy - no observational evidence was available until 1995. To the eye,
      exoplanets are lost in the glare of their host star. Unconventional techniques are
      required to infer or observe them. Here, exoplanet systems are represented by a blue
      ring centered on each host star. The ring is not intended to signify an orbit, but
      serve only as a marker. The labels list the host star name, and if there is more
      than one planet, will list the number of planets in parentheses. Census: 5,589
      planets in 4,139 systems.]]
