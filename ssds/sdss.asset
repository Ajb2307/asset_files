    Description = [[The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an ambitious project to image
      about 35% of the sky, deep into the universe. The SDSS galaxies form triangular
      wedges, revealing those parts of the sky observed by the telescope. If the entire
      sky were covered, you would see a spherical distribution of galaxies surrounding
      the Milky Way. With only 35% of the entire sky observed, we see only a few select
      slices or larger wedgelike portions from that sphere. The weblike cosmic structure
      is echoed in these data, with orange clusters standing out among the less dense
      aqua-colored galaxies and the less dense regions of green-colored galaxies.
      Census: 2,862,767 galaxies.]]
