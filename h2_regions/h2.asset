    Description = [[HII (pronounced "H-two") regions are stellar nurseries for newborn
            stars. Stars are born from condensing clouds of hydrogen gas. As these clouds
            condense, the densities become high enough to form stars. An HII region is the
            surrounding clouds of hydrogen that glow from the stars born within them. The
            result is a bright, glowing nebula which is seen to great distances. One local
            celebrity among HII regions is the Orion Nebula (M42). These star-forming regions
            lie in the plane of the Galaxy because that is where star formation occurs in
            spiral galaxies such as our Milky Way. Because of this, they are great tracers of
            the spiral arms of the Galaxy. Census: 1,108 star-forming regions.]]
